# Mushroom Classification Project

**Author:** David Rodriguez  
**Date:** March 2025

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification workflow using the Mushroom dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on physical characteristics.

The notebook walks through:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection
- Model training using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers
- Performance evaluation and reflection
